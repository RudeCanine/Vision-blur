# Vision Blur
A module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop, meant to help obscure token vision past a set range.

This module offers a friendly option for gamemasters and players who are interested in limiting the amount of information available on the map, with limited customizability.

*Note: Gamemasters are able to toggle a setting should they want to see what the players are seeing, and it disables once they release the token.*

**Made with Antigravity.**
